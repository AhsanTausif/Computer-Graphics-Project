Key Graphics Concepts Applied

1. The Transformation Matrix

In Three.js, every object has a .matrixWorld. 
 
When we move the camera to a "Follow" view, we calculate its position using:
 
P_world = M_vehicle *  P_local 
 
Where P_local$ is the offset (e.g. 8 units behind the car) and M_vehicle is the car's world matrix.

2. Camera Viewports

Follow View: Maintains a fixed distance relative to the vehicle's rotation.

Bird's Eye (Top-Down): Useful for showing spatial orientation on the XZ plane.

Side View: Useful for demonstrating the "profile" and wheel rotation.

3. Linear Interpolation (Lerp)

I used THREE.MathUtils.lerp for the speed. 

This prevents the car from stopping instantly, giving it a sense of momentum, which is a nice "extra credit" touch for graphics assignments.
